## Deployment Link


## Description
This project serves as a basic portfolio to demonstrate ability with React, allow interested parties to contact me, and display my work and resume.

This project uses React for the view layer of the site and JSX to create content to show on the page. We use conditional rendering to select which page should be shown to the user with event handlers to switch which page is being used. The contact page uses a form to allow users to fill out a message and email to send to contact me, with validations for the email and fields and submit button handling and state hooks to update inputs. Props are used to display necessary content including the list of competencies for the resume page.
